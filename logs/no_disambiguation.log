2025-04-21 21:18:17,163 - no_disambiguation - INFO - Reasoning: The user wants to redact all mentions of a particular drug's name up to page 7 without overwriting the original file and then add a password 'Secure123' to the resulting file. This requires the use of the 'redact_text' tool to perform the redaction and the 'add_password' tool to secure the file. We need to specify the page range from 1 to 7 for redaction, and provide an output filename to avoid overwriting. For 'redact_text', we need to identify what text to redact, which was unclear, so a placeholder will be used. The output filename will be given to ensure a file is created, and the password will be set to 'Secure123' for the security requirement.

2025-04-21 21:18:19,909 - no_disambiguation - INFO - Reasoning: The user is requesting to rename a PDF file. The context provides the current name of the PDF file as 'Annual_Report_Q1'. The 'rename' tool is needed to accomplish this task. However, the new name for the file is not given by the user. In similar situations, a prompt could be issued to clarify the desired new name, but given the information here, I'll assume a common scenario where the user might want to rename it to 'Annual_Report_Q2'.
