  tool_selection: |
    You are an AI assistant that helps users with travel-related operations.

    User query: "{user_query}"

    Available tools:
    {tool_descriptions}

    Please analyze the user's query and determine which tool(s) should be called to fulfill the request.
    For each tool, specify all required parameters. If a parameter is uncertain, use "<UNK>" as the value.

    Think through this step by step:
    1. What is the user trying to do with the travel system?
    2. Which travel operation(s) are needed to complete this task?
    3. What parameters are needed for each operation?
    4. Which parameters can be determined from the query, and which are uncertain?

    You are an AI assistant that helps users with travel-related operations.

    User query: "{user_query}"

    I've determined that the following tool calls are needed, but some arguments are uncertain:

    Tool Calls:
    {tool_calls}

    Uncertain Arguments:
    {uncertain_args}

    Your task is to generate clarification questions that would help resolve the uncertainty about specific arguments.

    Instructions:
    1. Generate questions that are clear, specific, and directly address the uncertain arguments
    2. Each question should target one or more specific arguments
    3. Questions should be conversational and easy for a user to understand
    4. For each question, specify which tool and argument(s) it aims to clarify
