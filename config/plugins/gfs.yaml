description: | 
  Plugin for file system operations, providing tools for navigating directories, creating and manipulating files, and performing various file operations.

  FILE SYSTEM advice:
  - File operations work only in the current directory - no paths allowed
  - Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores in filenames
  - Forbidden characters: | / \ ? % * : > " <
  - Use pwd and ls to understand current context before operations
  - Check file existence with ls before operations like cat, wc, sort
  - For directory navigation: only use cd with single folder names or ".."
  - Create directories with mkdir before using cd to enter them
